# ☁️ Project 1 – Monolithic App Migration to AWS

Welcome to the first project in my hands-on journey to become a strong **Cloud Solutions Architect** with a **DevOps edge**.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

I’m not just learning cloud architecture — I’m building it.

This is the first of 5 real-world projects where I design, document, and deploy solutions just like a real architect would. The goal is to solve practical business problems using AWS, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and smart DevOps practices — not just tutorials.

## 🤖 Why ChatGPT?

I’m treating ChatGPT as my mentor and design partner — not just for answers, but for *real-life project scenarios* and guidance. I asked it to simulate what a client might say, how a real architect would respond, and what a complete solution looks like. This helped me work through the **entire discovery-to-deployment lifecycle** as I would in a real consulting job.

📄 **What’s in this project?**
- Client scenario & discovery phase
- High-level AWS architecture design
- Terraform plan to validate infrastructure
- Cost estimation & roadmap
- Full solution documented like a real SA case study

This is just the beginning — more architecture-focused projects are coming soon.
